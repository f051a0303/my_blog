# My blog
This is the source code I created for academic purposes. It's a blog web application that enables users to share their thoughts and opinions after registering and logging in. It also keeps track of their login records and allows them to categorize their posts, making the information more organized.

Update: There is currently an issue with the PostgreSQL database I am using for this project, so the website may not function as expected. I will resolve this issue as soon as possible.
